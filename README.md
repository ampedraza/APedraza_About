  + Parkinson's Disease
     - Python language
     - Using voice data to predict Parkinson's disease in patients.
     - Various models explored:
        + KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression
     - Repository: [Python Predicting Parkinsons](https://github.com/ampedraza/Parkinsons-Disease)

  + Deep Learning Regression Model with Keras 
     - Assignment from Coursera IBM course: Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Keras
     - Keras, Numpy, and Pandas Libraries used.
     - Parts of the assignment:
        + Part A: Build a base model neural network with 1 hidden layer.
        + Part B: Use the base model with normalized data.
        + Part C: Use 100 Epochs.
        + Part D: Use 3 hidden layers.
    - For each part:
        +  data was split, trained, and tested on model 50 runs
        +  Calculated MSE for each run.
        +  Calculated mean and standard deviation of the 50 MSE values.
